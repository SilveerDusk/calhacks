            <p>Welcome to our project page. Introducing AIFred, "pronounced alfred", your friendly AI friend.
              The goal of AIFred was to create a jarvis like companion, a chat bot that you would interact with via speech
              and it would respond using text to speech. Our originial vision had three parts; Open-AI's whisper for speech recongnition and transcription,
              then from there the text would be sent to Chat-GBT and the response would be then sent to meta's mmms (Massively Multilingual Speech) model for text to speech purposes.
              However we ran into critical issues when fetching responeses from the text to speech api's.
